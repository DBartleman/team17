Mine shows my take on the UI of the app. We currently have a problem where scrolling is impossible because the map takes up too much space and the app thinks you are scrolling on the map and not on the page. I have hidden the map under a bar that can expand to show the map, and these bars can expand to show other functionality of the app. On the top right is a settings shortcut (gear) and an account shortcut (badly drawn person). Once the tabs are minimized, you can scroll.

This shows the core features of the app which include seeing your last listened locations, the users you choose to follow/those who follow you, and the data gathered presented in graphs in listening trends.

Cynthia Hong's Paper Prototype:

This shows the UI display and interaction after the user clicks on an active listener. After listing the active listen's top tracks, a user can play the song.
In the bottom one, users can select more options such as finding out a country's top tracks.
