Description: The login page works with any info currently, and we are still deciding on its design so it is just an outline. We have a basic dropdown menu layout for our UI. We are pretty satisfied with our layout on the main page of the app, we are just figuring out how to best organize all the music data for our app, then we will fine tune the UI more.
