###### Description of what pieces of feedback that you took from classmates and your TA to settle on this idea:
* From our hide and seek feedback people liked the idea of seeking. This music app isn't a game but it involves seeking out new music based on location. The geocaching prize idea can also be seen here. While you aren't getting a prize by venturing off to a specific location, the data presented to the user and finding new songs to listen to is the prize. The general feedback across our storyboards was that people like seeing data on things around them, so not only do you get to find new artists and songs by seeing what others are listening to, you can see more detailed information like what a specific user has been listening to or what types of songs are popular on campus(or any location near you) at different times of the day.
