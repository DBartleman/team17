This shows the basic view of the app, the user will be able to see what music is currently popular and can select the bubbles to see more detailed information

This shows what I think some basic functions of the app should be. The function descriptions are in pen and everything else is in thick marker.

This prototype shows the geographical music curation. The map takes parameters in the boxes on the left to display different types of music data as to what people listen to nearby in a map view. It also pulls a few songs and artists that are popular near you. From there you can listen to the suggestion or connect to users who like the artist or song. At the bottom, it displays users with similar music interests so you can connect to them.

1. You click on a pinned location (ex. Muir College), and it will give you a list of the most popular songs in that area under the map.
2. Same idea as #1, but it will open in a new page and show the number of listeners.
3. (Bottom left corner) Search a song or a genre and map is colored coded based on the number of listeners.
